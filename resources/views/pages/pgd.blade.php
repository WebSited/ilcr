          <p style="padding: 10px 25px; text-align: justify; margin-left: 20px; font-size: 0.9rem;">Land which is the bedrock of all man’s activities is always associated with disputes, linked with wealth and poverty, civil unrest and deaths, it has also been linked to Climate Change. Many scholars have reported that bad land governance and administration is responsible for the adverse effects. The programme is therefore proposed to enhance training opportunities and curricula on land governance in Nigeria, promoting demand driven research on land policy issues, connecting scholars and researchers across Africa through academic networks and finally to Engage staff and scholars in interdisciplinary research. </p>
